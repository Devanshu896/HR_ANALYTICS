-> This Power BI report analyzes employee attrition trends and workforce demographics using a comprehensive HR dataset of 1,480 records and 38 attributes.

-> It provides interactive visualizations to explore attrition rates across age groups, departments, job roles, and overtime status, helping identify factors influencing employee turnover.

-> The report includes detailed satisfaction metrics, such as Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance, enabling insights into employee engagement and retention.

-> Demographic breakdowns by gender, education level, and marital status offer a clear understanding of workforce composition.

🛠️ Technologies Used in the HR Analytics Dashboard
🔹 Microsoft Excel
Used for initial data cleaning and preprocessing. Basic formatting, handling missing values, and converting columns (like AgeGroup, SalarySlab) into meaningful categories were performed to ensure clean data input into Power BI.

🔹 SQL
SQL queries were used to perform data extraction and filtering from relational sources (if applicable). Example SQL operations include:

Selecting relevant employee records

Grouping attrition data by department or role

Joining multiple tables (if extended to a relational model)

🔹 Power BI
The core tool used to create the interactive HR analytics dashboard. Key features utilized:

Data modeling to build relationships and calculated measures (like Attrition Rate)

DAX formulas to compute KPIs such as average income, attrition percentage, and tenure statistics

Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, KPI cards, and slicers to enable dynamic, user-driven insights
